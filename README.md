# Rakurai Validator Node security

Rakurai’s validator node is managed by a dedicated team of professional engineers. We prioritize safety and reliability by implementing several key measures:

## Secure Login
Access to the node requires both a 4096-bit key pair and a password. This dual authentication method protects us from brute force attacks and private key compromises.

## VPN Access Only
The node is accessible exclusively through a secure VPN connection, adding an extra layer of protection.

## Firewall Protection
Our firewall is configured to block spam and prevent DDoS attacks, ensuring the node remains secure and operational.

## Backup Machines
We maintain backup machines that are ready to take over if the main machine experiences issues. These backups also handle voting during validator version updates, ensuring continuous service.

## Continuous Monitoring
We use a Grafana dashboard to monitor the node’s performance around the clock. This allows us to receive alerts and address any potential issues before they escalate.
